# Jack Assembler

It is a C++ app for the assignment of the 6th lesson of [nand2tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer). 



## Usage

1. Compile the cod.
2. Call it via terminal.
```bash
JackAssemble.exe anyASMFile.asm
```
The output .hack file will be created in the running directory.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. There are a few differences between my code and the documentation. But I did not work on it, I thought I got the concept of a simple assembler and plan to spend my time on another assignment.

A few improvements can be done:
1. CMD input file parameter. (Input file and executable file must be located in the same directory. I did not try to fix it...)
2. Algorithm architecture: Assembler v1 should be implemented as in the ideal configuration.
